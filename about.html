    <h1>Zeriah Group</h1>
    <p>
      The name <strong>Zeriah</strong> means “seeds” or “God has risen” — a reminder of growth, hope, and new beginnings.
      That spirit is what inspired the creation of Zeriah Group, the home where all our ventures take root.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than just a holding company, Zeriah Group is like a garden for ideas — a place where projects can be nurtured with care,
      given the right environment to grow, and supported as they branch into education, entertainment,
      or new opportunities we haven’t yet imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Zeriah Labs focuses on safe, meaningful learning, and Zeriah Studios focuses on lighthearted fun and bonding,
      Zeriah Group holds everything together with the same foundation of integrity, collaboration, and long-term growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is simple: to create a home where ideas are cared for, people are valued,
      and ventures can evolve naturally into something greater than the sum of their parts.
